# SPEC — 204 · NO-CONTENT studio site

## §G goal
Ship production static site for studio "204 · NO-CONTENT". Implement design/ Direction A "Night Shift" (cinematic noir) 1:1 in look/feel, but proper multi-file app: build tooling, components, routes, responsive, deployable anywhere static.

## §C constraints
- C1: stack = Vite + React 19 + TypeScript. SPA + react-router. No SSR framework.
- C2: no Babel-in-browser. No CDN react dev builds. All deps bundled.
- C3: fonts self-hosted via @fontsource: Archivo Black, Space Grotesk, JetBrains Mono, Instrument Serif. No runtime Google Fonts request.
- C4: design tokens fixed: bg `#0a0a0a`, fg `#ececec`, dim `rgba(236,236,236,0.55)`, hairline `rgba(236,236,236,0.14)`, accent `#c9442b`. Single source: CSS custom props.
- C5: `design/` = read-only reference (prototype). Never imported by app code. Excluded from build.
- C6: deploy target = any static host (CF Pages / Netlify / Vercel). SPA fallback config included.
- C7: prototype is fixed 1280×820 artboard → production must be responsive. Desktop = design fidelity; ≤768px = adapted layout, no horizontal scroll.
- C8: contact form client-side only (no backend). Submit → success state, same as prototype. mailto fallback link.
- C9: content (works, services, people, copy) verbatim from design/shared.jsx + direction-a.jsx. One data module. SUPERSEDED by C10 for real content.
- C11: content lives in content/*.json (works/services/people/studio) — code carries no copy. src/data/studio.ts = typed schema + derivations (ids, NC codes, slugs, stats, hero chapters, categories); scripts/generate-meta.mjs reads the same JSON for share meta + sitemap. CMS later = point it at content/.
- C10: real content source = 204-no-content.webflow.io scrape (snapshot design/scrape/extracted.json). Copy ADAPTED into Night Shift voice — inform, don't transplant; no invented facts. Design/layout unchanged.
- C12: media self-hosted in repo `public/media/`, committed plain git (no LFS). One-time pipeline `scripts/media-pipeline.mjs` (sharp + ffmpeg, local-only, ⊥ in CI deploy path): imgs → webp site renditions (full ≤1920w + `-p-800`) & jpg `-p-800` for og/share; video → single H.264 mp4 (1080p cap, CRF web-tuned), webm dropped (B5: Infinity duration). Originals cached `media-src/` (gitignored).
- C14: organism bg (liquid WebGPU creature): PROD-GATED — `VITE_ORGANISM=off` in all CI builds until explicit user go (2026-07-21); dev + lab only. three/webgpu + TSL, three version PINNED exact. WebGPU-ONLY — no WebGL fallback (user call 2026-07-21); `navigator.gpu` absent → feature fully disabled, site renders as today. Lazy chunk, loaded post-idle, ⊥ in entry bundle. Fixed bg layer in Layout: z 0, pointer-events none; content z 1. Obstacles = opt-in `data-organism-obstacle` elements only. First pass = pure-white silhouette (fill #fff, opacity 0.96, edge AA via fwidth), no bloom/glow/shading. Sim = fixed timestep PBD skeleton (core+attention+5 appendages×6 joints ≈32 particles); obstacle SDF via jump-flood compute; A* nav grid 64×36 on demand.
- C13: Firebase project `studio204-web` (display "204 · NO-CONTENT"), Blaze billing. Hosting = primary deploy → https://studio204-web.web.app, base `/`, canonical. GH Pages stays live secondary until custom domain cutover. Both deploy jobs in same workflow, both ! green.

## §I interfaces
- I.routes: `/` home, `/work`, `/work/:slug` detail, `/services`, `/services/:slug` detail, `/about`, `/contact`, `*` → 404.
- I.build: `npm run dev`, `npm run build` (tsc + vite build → dist/), `npm run preview`, `npm run lint`.
- I.deploy: `dist/` output. SPA rewrite: `public/_redirects` (`/* /index.html 200`) + `vercel.json` rewrite.
- I.seo: per-route `<title>` + meta description via route head hook. `index.html` base meta + og tags. `robots.txt`.
- I.firebase: `firebase.json` (hosting: public=dist, SPA rewrite → /index.html, per-path Cache-Control headers), `.firebaserc` (default=studio204-web). CI deploy: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy w/ repo secret `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_STUDIO204_WEB` (service acct JSON). Local: `firebase deploy --only hosting`.
- I.organism: `src/organism/` module (OrganismBackground/Controller/Simulation/Renderer/Parameters/DebugPanel + obstacle/ navigation/ simulation/ shaders/ math/ per handoff §5). Typed `OrganismConfig` central — no scattered magic numbers. DOM contract: `data-organism-obstacle` + `data-organism-padding|weight|allow-tendrils|hidden`. Capabilities: `{backend: 'webgpu'|'none', computeSupported, quality}`. Debug views (mask/sdf/skeleton/field/contacts) dev-only, stripped from prod. Coordinate converters viewportPx↔simulation↔obstacleUv unit-tested.
- I.media: `scripts/media-pipeline.mjs` — scan content/*.json + src/index.html/scripts for cdn.prod.website-files.com urls → fetch originals → media-src/ → optimize → public/media/ + write url→path manifest → rewrite refs. Idempotent, rerun-safe.

## §V invariants
- V1: prod bundle contains zero references to unpkg/babel-standalone/react.development. `grep -r "unpkg\|babel" dist/assets` → empty.
- V2: token values in code match §C4 exactly; defined once in `:root` CSS vars; components reference vars, never re-hardcode hex (exception: SVG scene art inside CinematicStill).
- V3: all 5 routes deep-linkable: direct URL load renders correct page (SPA fallback).
- V4: fonts + app code + media ALL self-hosted, no third-party runtime requests except: GA4 gtag.js (G-E2HCBBXBVP, explicit request) & click-to-load youtube + OSM tiles. `grep -rl "website-files" src content index.html scripts dist` → only scripts/media-pipeline.mjs (migration tool scan regex; design/ scrape snapshot also exempt, read-only ref).
- V5: `npm run build` exits 0 with zero TS errors. `npm run lint` exits 0.
- V6: no horizontal overflow at 360px, 768px, 1280px, 1920px viewport widths.
- V7: rAF/interval animations (CinematicStill, hover preview timecode) gated by `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` → static frame.
- V8: custom cursor active only on `(pointer: fine)`; touch devices keep native cursor + hover-preview features degrade gracefully (no hover trap).
- V9: app code never imports from `design/`; `design/` not in tsconfig include, not in vite root scan.
- V10: every route sets unique title + meta description on navigation.
- V11: floating overlays (work hover preview) stay fully inside viewport; never extend document scroll height or sit under fixed nav.
- V12: display type + hero scale fluidly past 1280 (vw-based clamps, caps ≈1.5× design size); display tracking = prototype value `-0.02px` (NOT em).
- V13: content constrained to max 1720px centered shell on wide screens; nav bar full-bleed w/ inner capped; nav/labels/chapter type fluid (no fixed tiny px on hidpi).
- V14: ∀ /media/** response → `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; hashed /assets/** same; index.html + generated route HTML → no-cache/short. Content change → new filename (⊥ edit in place under same name).
- V15: media weight budget: public/media total ≤ 80MB; ∀ video ≤ 40MB (quality > squeeze, user call 2026-07-21); ∀ img file ≤ 2MB; ∀ site-rendered img ≤ 500KB @ used rendition.
- V17: organism canvas ⊥ intercepts pointer events; core ⊥ enters hard obstacle regions; UI text readability preserved (content above, opt-in obstacles protect marked elements).
- V18: organism = separate lazy chunk, entry bundle unchanged; no WebGPU → zero runtime cost beyond capability check; V5/V6 hold w/ feature on & off.
- V19: organism sim fixed-timestep + interpolation (frame-rate independent, no explosion after tab restore); reduced-motion → feature fully disabled, no special mode (user call 2026-07-21, extends V7); no per-frame DOM layout reads on static pages; no GPU→CPU readback in loop.
- V16: dual deploy: GH Pages build (VITE_BASE=/204.ai-web/) & Firebase build (base /) both exit 0; canonical + sitemap urls → Firebase (SITE_URL=https://studio204-web.web.app) until domain cutover.

B24|2026-07-22|ceiling shuffle: A* open list w/o dedupe exploded past 2000 safety cap in off-shell frontiers → abort → straight-line [goal] fallback; LOS smoothing then collapsed even valid wall routes into one far mid-air waypoint; decide() jumped to that waypoint (far carrot) → travelDir projected on ceiling tangent flip-flopped|open-list dedupe (inOpen flags, cap n); shellCut smoothing (shortcuts must stay near shell); decide() interpolates within segments to exact 0.28 arc
B23|2026-07-22|"glass fence" standoff at obstacle contact: 16px data-organism-padding baked into mask hard channel → GPU cut plane 16px off the visible edge; wide smax blend (R*0.22) + press highlight smeared a half-tone wall there|hard channel rasterized at true geometry (pad 0 — solver/nav keep padded analytic copies); cut k → R*0.09; press highlight retired
